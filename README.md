About
-----
Siriproxy-ipcam is a [SiriProxy] (https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy) plugin that allows you to push IP camera images to Apple's Siri interface on any iOS device that supports Siri.   It does not require a jailbreak, nor do I endorse doing so.

First, you must have SiriProxy installed and working.  [HOW-TOs for Siriprixy] (https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy/wiki/Installation-How-Tos) 

Second, you must have at least one IP camera on your local network that supports image/video streaming.  

Third, in order to support images from IP cameras requiring authentication, you need to have access to or set up a web server on your SiriProxy server to cache the camera image to push to Siri.  Simply type `apt-get install apache2 -y`.   The default configuration for APACHE will work.   SiriProxy will need write permission to the `/var/www/` folder, which if you are running SiriProxy as ROOT will be able to write the camera image. 

Here is a short demonstration video: Coming soonâ€¦   

I have received offers to make a donation to my project to help offset the cost of hardware and for my time.  If you feel so inclined you can donate thru PayPal.

Cameras
-------

Hopefully the documentation for your IP camera provides the URL for grabbing a still image.  If not, while I have not found a single resource that documents all the make and model IP camera image URLs, this site is a good reference: http://www.ispyconnect.com/sources.aspx

BTW, The Windows open source [iSpy security camera software] (http://www.ispyconnect.com) is the best I have come across.  While there are no Mac OS X or Linux versions, the source code is avaiable and they are adding support mobile device HTML5 access.
