siriproxy-picturejokes
======================

About
-----
Siriproxy-picturejokes is a [SiriProxy] (https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy) plugin that allows you to push cutom picture and text to Apple's Siri interface on any iOS device that supports Siri.   It does not require a jailbreak, nor do I endorse doing so.

First, you must have SiriProxy installed and working.  Second, you need to have access to or set up a web server on your SiriProxy server to host the custom pictures you want to push to Siri.  Simply type `apt-get install apache2`.   The default configuration for APACHE will work.   Your pictures need to reside in the `/var/www/` folder.  


A Bit on Pictures
-----------------
- Pictures that are at least 640 pixels in width with be centered on the screen.  iOS will resize wider photos to fit.  
- Pictures with 3x2 aspect ratio fill the screen, leaving room for the Siri bar.  
- iOS seems to support multiple picture formats.  I have have used jpg, jpeg, png files.  Not sure about other formats.  
- I have noticed pictures are antimated differently depending on the picture format.  Example: PNG files rotate in.   JPG files will scroll in.  I haven't explored using different file formats to see how they are antimated.  
- The pictures used in this example were rescalled from low quality images. Refrain from using copyprotected photos.
